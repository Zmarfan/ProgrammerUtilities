## Installation

[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fck0Ja83W9nJg5wO3Cf1nHyFKcXqyGD_?usp=sharing) and run either *ProgrammerUtilsInstaller.msi* or *ProgrammerUtilsInstaller.exe* to install ProgrammerUtilities. The installation process will create a desktop shortcut called *ProgrammerUtilities* which will start the program. 

## How to use

The program can perform 5 different tasks which all can be accessed throught the navigation menu to the left side of the widow. The navigation menu can easily be closed and opened. The 5 different tasks ProgrammerUtilities can perform are: *Sort, Compare, Count, HTML:ify & Generate Text.*

### Sort

Write the entries you want to sort in the left textbox seperated by either commas or newlines. In the top part of the window there exists settings that you can tweak to get the output you are looking for. These include how the entries should be sorted and how they will be displayed. You can also toggle *Auto Sort* mode which will sort while you type. For large amount of entries this option should be turned off. The big button labeled *Sort* in the top left will sort the entries. The sorted list will be displayed in the right textbox under the tab *List*. In the tab *Enum* the sorted list will be converted to an enum class with the entries as fields. The specific programming language this enum should be in, and what it will be called, can be set in the bottom right corner. The buttons to the far right of the sorting window will toggle how each entry should be displayed. This includes the *capitalisation button* (All-caps, All-lower, No-change) & *underscore button*. There also exists two copy buttons; one for copying the *List* textbox and one for copying the *Enum* textbox. Lastly there is a *Clear* button which removes all current information.

### Compare

Write the texts you want to compare in the two textboxes to the left labeled *Text one* and *Text two*. In the top part of the window there exists settings that you can tweak to get the output you are looking for. These include how exact the comparison should be. Should the comparator care about capitalisation and extra whitespaces? You can also toggle *Compare mode* which decides how the *Combined tab* output should behave. It can either compare line by line or word by word. You can also toggle *Auto Compare* mode which will compare while you type. For larger texts this option should be turned off. Lastly there is a *Clear* button which removes all current information. The final comparision can be viewed on the right side of the window. This can either be viewed in *Separate view* or *Combined view*.

### Count

Write the text you want to be counted in the textbox to the left. In the top part of the window there exists settings that you can tweak to get the output you are looking for. These include how the information should be displayed and whether it should care about capitalisation. There also exists a *Clear* button which will remove all current information. The ouput to the right consists of text information, word frequency, word density and word uniqueness.

### HTML:ify

Html:ify will turn regular text into HTML text. Enter the text you want to convert into the textbox on the left side of the window. Use the text style buttons below the textbox to change the text style. In the top part of the window there exists settings that you can tweak to get the output you are looking for. These include a *Custom Rules* button which allows you to create your own rules of the conversion. A rule consists of a character to exchange and what text it should be replaced with. The rules can be toggled on and off and will be saved even after the program terminates. There also are coloring options which allows you to change colors of the tags the output might contain. The final output will be displayed in the textbox to the right. To copy the text you can use the *Copy* button on the far right. There also exists a *Clear* button which removes all current information and a *HTML Special Chars* button which will open your web browser on [this page](https://www.html.am/reference/html-special-characters.cfm).

### Generate Text

Enter how many words to generate, which paragraph type the text should have and paragraph size on the top part of the window. Then press the *Generate Text* button to generate the text. The generated text will be displayed in the textbox. Copy this text using the *Copy* button to the right. Clear all information using the *Clear* button to the right. If you want you can enter a custom seed which always will generate the same text for every seed.
