### Sort

Write the entries you want to sort in the left textbox seperated by either commas or newlines. In the top part of the window there exists settings that you can tweak to get the output you are looking for. These include how the entries should be sorted and how they will be displayed. You can also toggle *Auto Sort* mode which will sort while you type. For large amount of entries this option should be turned off. The big button labeled *Sort* in the top left will sort the entries. The sorted list will be displayed in the right textbox under the tab *List*. In the tab *Enum* the sorted list will be converted to an enum class with the entries as fields. The specific programming language this enum should be in, and what it will be called, can be set in the bottom right corner. The buttons to the far right of the sorting window will toggle how each entry should be displayed. This includes the *capitalisation button* (All-caps, All-lower, No-change) & *underscore button*. There also exists two copy buttons; one for copying the *List* textbox and one for copying the *Enum* textbox. Lastly there is a *Clear* button which removes all current information.
